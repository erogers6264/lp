## Following along with buildyourownlisp.com
 - Taking the opportunity to experiment with C so I can better understand how Python was implemented with Cpython
 - Practicing techniques for writing efficient code quickly for better interview performance.
 - Learning applications for techniques like library usage, recursion, tree structures, pointers, memory allocation, and a lot more.
 - Going into greater depth with the functional programming paradigm, (features of which are also available in Python)
 
## Project Description
One of the goals of this project is to get experience developing a 'real' application in C. Developing my own Lisp in C is a really cool project. Getting to learn about trees in computer science reminds me of my college days studying linguistics and learning about syntax trees.
